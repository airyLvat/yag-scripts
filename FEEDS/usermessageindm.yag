Hey {{.User.Mention}}, welcome to the Scripture Alone family!

We hope you enjoy your time with us. Be sure to check out our many informative channels such as #games-info for our self-hosted coding server and game servers. We also have a mentorship and scripture reading program (visit the ask-staff channel for more details), and a full library of information in the #scriptorium channel. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask our staff. Whether you're a Christian seeking fellowship, curious about the Christian faith, or joining us for another reason, we are glad you're here.

God bless,
Scripture Alone Staff
